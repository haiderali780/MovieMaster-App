# MovieMaster-App



This is a dummy login form built with React that demonstrates the use of local storage, the useReducer hook, the React Context API, side effects, forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, and the useEffect hook.



## Working
This app allows users to add and manage information about movies. With the app, users can add the following information about a movie:

- Title
- Opening text
- Release date

Once the information is entered, it is stored in a Firebase database through an API. Users can then retrieve this information from the database through a REST API.

In the event that something goes wrong with the API, an error message will be displayed. A loading animation will also be shown until the data is successfully fetched.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
- **git clone https://github.com/haiderali780/MovieMaster-App.git**
- **cd dummy-login-form**
2. Install the dependencies:
**npm install**
3. Start the development server:
**npm start**
4. The login form will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.
